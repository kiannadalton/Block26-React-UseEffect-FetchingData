# Block26-React-UseEffect-FetchingData

In this block, I am reviewing the basics of fetching data and synchronizing my React applications with the useEffect Hook.

## Learning Lessons:

React thrives off the idea of components. In the demo, App.jsx is the main gathering point for components for main, but TaskList.jsx is a child component of parent App.jsx. This lesson introduced props and useEffects, and it also introduced this idea of showing 'Loading' while we wait for the information to be fetched. This could have been added in App.jsx, but it was a learning lesson to see that it would be more effective to add it in the related child component--TaskList.jsx--since it would allow the TaskList.jsx component to be more versatile and keep App.jsx easier to read.

## Demonstrates use of:

props, useState, useEffect, onClick, ternary operator, if/else, async/await, fetch, .map, json()
